# Restaurant-WebAppp-DBMS
Restaurant Website, themed to be owned by robots, created for my Database management course. 
You can run it by hosting it on your own web server, and starting at localhost/resteraunt.html
To use all of the functionality you will have to have an sql server running at port 3306, and will have to import the sample resteraunt database .txt included.

Live demo demonstrating the functionality can be found here: https://youtu.be/AQB9qml7RN4
