# Restaurant-WebApp-DBMS
Restaurant Website, themed to be owned by robots, created for my Database management course. 
You can run it by hosting it on your own web server, and starting at localhost/restaurant.html
To use all of the functionality you will have to have an sql server running at port 3306, and will have to import the sample restaurant database .txt into your database. It is created to use Python Data Objects so it is database independent.

Live demo demonstrating the functionality can be found here: https://youtu.be/AQB9qml7RN4

The designed Entity-Relationship diagram is also included in the repository.
